 Write a C program that constructs a threaded binary search tree (TBST) from a sequence of N integers. The program should allow the user to input the number of elements (N) and the N integers to build the TBST. After constructing the TBST, implement a function pathExists that determines if a given path (a sequence of nodes) exists in the TBST, utilizing threaded links to optimize the search.

Input Format

5 //Number of elements in the TBST 5 //Elements of TBST 4 3 2 1 3 //Length of path 1 //Elements of the path 2 3

Constraints

0<=Number of elements<=1000

Output Format

Path does not exist.
